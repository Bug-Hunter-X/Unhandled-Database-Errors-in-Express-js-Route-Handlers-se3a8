# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handlers

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Express.js applications: unhandled database errors within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks comprehensive error handling for database operations. If the database query fails (e.g., due to a network issue or incorrect query), the application will crash or return a generic 500 error, hindering debugging and providing a poor user experience.

## Solution

The solution involves using `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors during database interactions.  Appropriate error messages are returned to the client, and logging mechanisms can be added for debugging purposes.  This prevents application crashes and improves overall robustness.
